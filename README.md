# Goats-and-Grass-
This project is a simulation game that models the interaction between goats (predators) and grass (prey) in a bounded 2D world. It was initially developed as part of an assignment in NCCU's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class, focusing on demonstrating key concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance.
